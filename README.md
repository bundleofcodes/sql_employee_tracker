# sql_employee_tracker

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a command line application that allows a user to manage information on employees within a company. The application connects to a database housed in MySQL that contains three tables with information on departments, roles, and employees within the company. This Content Management System allows a user to add, view and modify information about employees of the company. I experienced a huge learning curve with this project, especially as it pertains to the localhost, which cannot be used on MACOS, but instead I had to apply 127.0.0.1 in order for my applicaiton to run.
